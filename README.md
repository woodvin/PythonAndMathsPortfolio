# 🧠 Python & Maths Foundations Portfolio

This repository is a clear, structured record of my journey building strong foundations in **Python programming** and the **core mathematics** needed for data, quant, and software work. It exists to provide **real, visible proof** of my skills - not just statements on a CV.

Everything here is built through self-study alongside my degree apprenticeship, and is focused on the fundamentals that matter long-term: clean coding, solid mathematical reasoning, and practical problem-solving.

## 📘 What This Repo Covers

The notebooks progress in a deliberate, quant-aligned order:

### **1️⃣ Python Foundations**
To ensure I can implement every mathematical idea in clean, readable code.  
Covers Python basics, NumPy, pandas, visualisation, and mathematical coding techniques.

### **2️⃣ Core Mathematical Foundations**
Calculus, differentiation, integration, multivariable functions, and the mathematical ideas that all quant topics rely on.

### **3️⃣ Intermediate Maths for Quants**
Gradients, Jacobians, Hessians, Taylor expansions, and multivariable integration — the language of optimisation, ML, and stochastic calculus.

### **4️⃣ Probability Theory**
Random variables, expectation, covariance, distributions, Bayes, moment-generating functions, LLN & CLT - the backbone of quant finance.

### **5️⃣ Statistics & Inference**
Sampling, estimation, hypothesis testing, MLE, regression theory - everything required for modelling data or markets.

### **6️⃣ Linear Algebra (Quant Focused)**
Eigenvalues, covariance matrices, matrix calculus, PCA - essential for portfolio theory, factor models, and risk.

### **7️⃣ Numerical Methods & Optimisation**
Gradient descent, Newton’s method, constrained optimisation, convexity - the foundation of calibration and modelling.

### **8️⃣ Time Series Analysis**
Returns, volatility, autocorrelation, ARIMA, GARCH - core tools for analysing market behaviour.

### **9️⃣ Stochastic Calculus**
Brownian motion, Itô calculus, SDEs, Black-Scholes - the mathematical core of derivatives pricing.

### **🔟 Quant Toolkit (Applied)**
Monte Carlo simulations, pricing models, Greeks, risk metrics, and portfolio optimisation.

Each section builds directly into the next, creating a full end-to-end pathway toward quant-level skills.

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

This portfolio exists to:

- **Demonstrate real capability** not claims. Every notebook shows evidence of what I can actually do.  
- **Build foundational skills** for future work in software, quant, and data roles.  
- **Show progression**: each notebook builds on the last.  
- **Train good habits**: documentation, clarity, reproducibility, and structured learning.  
- **Show initiative** beyond my degree; proving I can self-teach maths and programming at a high standard.

This is not a tutorial repo - it is proof of consistent learning and self-development.

## 📈 Current Focus

- Strengthening Python fundamentals  
- Building confidence with NumPy & pandas  
- Writing clear, structured mathematical derivations  
- Connecting maths → code in small applied examples  

More notebooks and projects will be added continuously as I progress.
